This project makes it easy to add support for `one-time passwords
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password>`_ (OTPs) to Django. It can be
integrated at various levels, depending on how much customization is required.
It integrates with ``django.contrib.auth``, although it is not a Django
authentication backend. The primary target is developers wishing to incorporate
OTPs into their Django projects as a form of `two-factor authentication
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication>`_.

Several simple OTP plugins are included and more are available separately. This
package also includes an implementation of OATH `HOTP
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226>`_ and `TOTP
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238>`_ for convenience, as these are standard
OTP algorithms used by multiple plugins.

If you're looking for a higher-level or more opinionated solution, you might be
interested in `django-two-factor-auth
<https://github.com/Bouke/django-two-factor-auth>`_.

Development
-----------

Development dependencies are defined in the Pipfile; use `pipenv`_ to set up a
suitable shell.

The tests in tox.ini cover a representative sample of supported Python and
Django versions, as well as running `flake8`_ and `isort`_ for linting and style
consistency. Please run `tox` before checking in and sending a pull request.
